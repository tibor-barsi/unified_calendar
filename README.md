# Unified Calendar

A full-stack web app that shows your **Microsoft Outlook** and **Google
Calendar** events together in one view — colour-coded by source, with
month / week / day toggles. No database: events are fetched live from each API
and cached client-side.

Two ways to add a calendar — use either or both:

1. **ICS subscription (no login)** — paste a published `.ics` URL. Zero setup,
   read-only, works immediately. Best for "just show me the events".
2. **OAuth login** — full Microsoft/Google sign-in via Passport.js. Needs the
   one-time app registration below, but always reflects your live calendar.

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + Passport.js (OAuth2) + `node-ical`
- **Frontend:** vanilla JS + [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/) (via CDN)
- **APIs:** Microsoft Graph (`/me/calendarView`), Google Calendar v3, ICS feeds

A **⚙ Settings** page (top-right) manages everything in one place:
accounts (connect/disconnect Outlook & Google), ICS subscriptions (add/remove),
and calendar preferences — week start day, default view, 12/24-hour time, and
weekend visibility. Feeds, preferences and the OAuth tokens persist to `data/`
across restarts; events are fetched live on every request and their bodies are
not written to disk by the server. Two things do reach disk: the ids of the
events you star (kept in `data/settings.json`), and — when the widget's offline
cache is switched on — a reduced copy of each event. The desktop widget keeps a
fuller cache of its own; both are described under [Widget API](#widget-api)
below.

The **Calendars** sidebar lets you, per calendar:

- **Recolor** it (click the color swatch) — applies instantly.
- **Show/hide** it (checkbox) — filtered instantly in the browser.

Events are fetched once per visible date range and cached client-side, so
toggling visibility or changing colors is instant (no API round-trip).

Other niceties:

- **Sync:** the **⟳ Sync** button clears the cache and pulls fresh events.
- **Search:** press **`/`** to open a search box — filter events by title,
  description, location, or calendar; or jump to a date with natural language
  ("next monday", "june 2026", "2026-06-15").
- **Keyboard navigation:** **←** / **→** arrow keys move to the previous/next
  time period (week, month, or day depending on the current view).
- **Event details:** click any event for a popup with its calendar, time,
  location, description, and a link to open the original.
- **Day peek:** in month view, click an empty part of a day to open that day
  in a detailed timeline.
- **Create / edit events:** click an empty slot or drag to select a range;
  requires Google Calendar connected with write access.

## Mobile & PWA

The app is fully usable on a smartphone:

- The week view fills the screen; the **Calendars** sidebar slides in from the
  left via the **☰** hamburger button and can be dismissed by tapping the
  backdrop.
- The topbar collapses to just the essentials on small screens.

The app is also installable as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**:

- On Android (Chrome): tap the browser menu → *Add to Home Screen*.
- On iOS (Safari): tap Share → *Add to Home Screen*.

Once installed, the app shell (HTML, CSS, JS, and FullCalendar) is cached by
the service worker and loads instantly — even without an internet connection.
Events from the last sync are available offline via the client-side cache.

To force-refresh cached assets after an app update, bump `CACHE_NAME` in
`public/sw.js` from `cal-v1` to `cal-v2` (or any new value).

---

## Optional password authentication

By default the app has no login — suitable for local use. To protect it when
running on a server, set `AUTH_PASSWORD` in your `.env`:

```ini
AUTH_PASSWORD=your-secret-password
```

When set:

- Every request is gated behind a login page.
- A successful login sets a signed, `HttpOnly` cookie that lasts **1 year**,
  so the device stays unlocked without re-entering the password.
- On HTTPS (`BASE_URL=https://...`) the cookie is also marked `Secure`.
- A **↩ sign-out** button appears in the top-right corner.
- Changing `AUTH_PASSWORD` immediately invalidates all existing sessions.

Leave `AUTH_PASSWORD` unset (or remove it) to disable authentication entirely.

---

## Reaching it from another machine

The app binds to **`127.0.0.1`** — this machine only. That is deliberate: with no
`AUTH_PASSWORD` set there is no login at all, and `data/settings.json` always
holds OAuth refresh tokens in plaintext — the CalDAV password too, on a machine
with no system keyring (below). Listening on every interface would hand a
personal calendar to anyone who can reach the port.

The CalDAV password doesn't have to be one of those plaintext copies: on first
start the server moves it out of `data/settings.json` and into the system
keyring (`secret-tool`, i.e. libsecret — gnome-keyring or any other Secret
Service provider), blanking the plaintext copy only once it has read the
keyring copy back and confirmed it matches. With no keyring on the machine — no
`secret-tool`, a locked one, whatever — the plaintext copy just keeps working,
so the keyring is an enhancement, not a dependency.

`HOST=0.0.0.0` opens it up. Only do that together with `AUTH_PASSWORD`, and
preferably not on its own — the app speaks plain HTTP, so a password travels in
clear text across the network. Either of these is better:

- **A VPN — the simplest.** Leave `HOST` at `127.0.0.1` on the server and reach it
  over Tailscale/WireGuard, or through an SSH tunnel:
  `ssh -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000 you@server`. Nothing is exposed publicly at all.
- **A TLS reverse proxy.** Caddy or nginx terminates HTTPS and forwards to
  `127.0.0.1:3000`; set `AUTH_PASSWORD` and `BASE_URL=https://...` so the session
  cookie is marked `Secure`.

Note that the Omarchy bar widget cannot authenticate: it fetches with plain `curl`
and sends no cookie, so it gets 401 on every poll against an install that sets
`AUTH_PASSWORD`. Run the widget against a loopback instance, not a protected one.

Starting with a non-loopback `HOST` and no `AUTH_PASSWORD` prints a warning on
boot; it does not stop the server.

## Widget API

Five JSON endpoints serve the desktop widget (`omarchy-widget/`) — two for
events, three for CalDAV tasks. All five send `Cache-Control: no-store`, never
touch the session cookie, and — when `AUTH_PASSWORD` is set — require the same
`cal_auth` cookie as the web app (otherwise `401`).

**`GET /api/widget/events?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD`**

- `start` and `end` are plain calendar dates in the server's local timezone.
- `end` is **exclusive**: a single day is `start=2026-09-15&end=2026-09-16`.
- The range must be at least 1 and at most **100 days** (`400` otherwise).
- Returns `{ generatedAt, range, calendars, events, errors, stale, syncedAt }`.
  Each event is `{ id, title, start, end, allDay, calId, calendar, color,
  location, notes, meetingUrl, url, important }`.
- `stale` lists `{ provider, syncedAt }` for each provider that failed this
  round and was served from the cache instead; `syncedAt` is the oldest of
  those timestamps (or `generatedAt` when nothing is stale). With the cache off
  (the default) `stale` is always empty.
- `502` when the fetch fails and there is nothing cached to fall back on.

**`POST /api/widget/important`** — body `{ "id": "<event id>", "important":
true|false }` (JSON, max 2 KB). Stars/unstars one event, stored in
`data/settings.json`. Responds with the same `{ id, important }` pair.

### `UNIFIED_CALENDAR_WIDGET_CACHE` — offline event cache (off by default)

Set `UNIFIED_CALENDAR_WIDGET_CACHE=1` (or `true`) to let the widget keep
serving events while a provider is unreachable. It is the only event data the
**server** writes to disk, so it is opt-in:

- On: each queried range is written to `data/widget-cache.json` (mode `0600`),
  and a provider that fails is served from it and reported in `stale`.
- Only the fields a cached render needs are stored: `id`, `title`, `start`,
  `end`, `allDay`, `calId`, `color`, `source`. Descriptions, locations, meeting
  links, original URLs and CalDAV identifiers are **never** written.
- The file is bounded: at most 24 ranges and 1 MB, least-recently-used ranges
  dropped first.
- Off (unset, `0`, `false`): nothing is written, and the widget works exactly as
  before online — only the offline `stale` / `syncedAt` fallback is lost.

Both the cache and the rest of the persisted state live in `data/`, or in
`UNIFIED_CALENDAR_DATA_DIR` when that is set. Delete `data/widget-cache.json` at
any time; it is rebuilt on demand. A file left behind by an older build holds
full event bodies — restart the server first (`systemctl --user restart
calendar`) so the reducing code is live, then delete it, or a server still
running the old code rewrites it on the next widget poll.

This flag does **not** reach the desktop widget's own cache. Whatever the flag
is set to, the widget writes every range it fetched to
`~/.cache/unified-calendar-widget/events.json` — before 0.2 a single flat file,
`~/.cache/unified-calendar-widget.json` (see the widget's own README for the
migration) — exactly as the API returned it: full event bodies, `notes`
(descriptions), `location` and `meetingUrl` included, so its panel can still
render while the server is down. Tasks get the same unconditional treatment in
a sibling file, `tasks.json` — neither has a setting that turns it off. Delete
a file to clear it; the widget rewrites it on the next poll.

### Tasks (VTODO)

Three more JSON endpoints, alongside the two above, read and write tasks from
the same CalDAV account. They follow the same rules: `Cache-Control: no-store`,
no session cookie, and the `cal_auth` cookie when `AUTH_PASSWORD` is set.

**`GET /api/widget/tasks`** → `{ tasks, lists, syncedAt, errors }`. Each task
is `{ id, uid, title, notes, status, completed, completedAt, due, dueHasTime,
start, priority, percent, categories, listId, listName, listUrl, accountId,
etag }`. `due` is a plain `YYYY-MM-DD` for a date-only DUE, or an ISO UTC
string when it carries a time — `dueHasTime` says which. A list that fails to
fetch is reported in `errors` as `{ listId, message }`; the other lists still
return their tasks. No CalDAV account configured is not an error: `tasks` and
`lists` come back empty with `200`.

**`POST /api/widget/tasks`** — body `{ text, listId? }`, `text` 1-500
characters, parsed with the quick-add grammar below. Returns `{ task }` and
`201`. An unknown `listId` is `404`; text that parses down to an empty title is
`400`.

**`POST /api/widget/tasks/complete`** — body `{ id, completed }`. Returns
`{ task }`, or `409` when the task changed on the server since it was fetched
(an etag mismatch) — refetch and retry rather than overwrite someone else's
edit.

Task-list discovery is a PROPFIND, expensive enough that it's cached in memory
for an hour rather than repeated on every poll. A failed discovery is never
cached, so the next call retries it.

**Quick-add syntax**, used by `POST /api/widget/tasks` and the widget's own
quick-add field:

| Token | Means |
|---|---|
| `@word` | a category (repeatable) |
| `!1`-`!9` | priority |
| `due:<when>` | see below |
| everything left over | the title |

`due:` accepts `today`, `tomorrow`, a weekday name (`friday`/`fri`, meaning the
next such day, never today), `YYYY-MM-DD`, `D.M.` or `D.M.YYYY`, `+3d`, `+2w`.
An unparseable `due:` token stays in the title rather than being dropped.
Tokens are only recognised as whole, whitespace-separated words, so an email
address or `!important` inside running text is left alone.

**What the CalDAV server keeps.** These are limits of the Open-Xchange
(mailbox.org) backend, checked against a live server — not of this code:

- Only `DTSTART`, `DUE`, `CATEGORIES`, `SUMMARY`, `PRIORITY`, `DESCRIPTION`,
  `VALARM`, `STATUS`, `PERCENT-COMPLETE` and `COMPLETED` survive a round trip;
  anything else is silently discarded.
- No recurring tasks — an `RRULE` on a VTODO is rejected — and no subtasks:
  `RELATED-TO` is dropped.
- Priority collapses to three buckets on save: 1-2 → 1, 3-6 → 5, 7-9 → 9, so a
  task added as `!2` comes back as `!1`. The client collapses to the same
  buckets before displaying a value, so a refresh never changes what's on
  screen.
- `sync-collection` is advertised but unreliable for task collections in
  practice, so every poll does a full fetch instead of an incremental one.

## Running as a daily-driver service

The app is meant to run permanently in the background on port **3000** and be
managed with `systemctl`.

### Install the service (one-time)

`calendar.service` is a template: it cannot know where you cloned this or where
your `node` lives, so edit `WorkingDirectory` and `ExecStart` before copying it.

```bash
cp calendar.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
$EDITOR ~/.config/systemd/user/calendar.service   # set WorkingDirectory + ExecStart
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now calendar
```

The service auto-starts on login and restarts if it crashes.

> **On Omarchy?** `omarchy-widget/install.sh` does all of the above — writing the
> unit with the right paths, picking the port, starting the service — and then
> installs the bar widget. See [`omarchy-widget/README.md`](omarchy-widget/README.md).

### Day-to-day commands

| What            | Command                                   |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Open in browser | <http://localhost:3000>                   |
| Start           | `systemctl --user start calendar`         |
| Stop            | `systemctl --user stop calendar`          |
| Restart         | `systemctl --user restart calendar`       |
| Status          | `systemctl --user status calendar`        |
| Live logs       | `journalctl --user -u calendar -f`        |

### Desktop launcher (optional)

Installs a "Calendar" entry in your app launcher (GNOME, KDE, etc.):

```bash
cp calendar.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/
```

Clicking it opens `http://localhost:3000` in your default browser (the service
must already be running).

## Option A — ICS subscription (no registration)

Want events showing in under a minute, without registering any app? Use this.

1. Start the service (see above), then open <http://localhost:3000>.
2. Expand **"➕ Subscribe to a calendar by ICS link"**, paste a published
   `.ics` URL, give it a label, click **Add**. Both `https://` and `webcal://`
   links work.
3. Get the `.ics` URL from your calendar:
   - **Outlook (web):** Settings → Calendar → **Shared calendars** →
     *Publish a calendar* → publish → copy the **ICS** link.
   - **Google Calendar:** Settings → click the calendar → **Integrate calendar**
     → copy **Secret address in iCal format**.

ICS feeds are read-only and fetched live. The OAuth options below give
richer/live access but need one-time setup.

---

## 1. Register the Microsoft Azure app (Outlook)

1. Go to the **Azure Portal** → <https://portal.azure.com> → search
   **"App registrations"** → **New registration**.
2. **Name:** anything, e.g. `Unified Calendar`.
3. **Supported account types:** choose
   *"Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts"*
   (this matches `MICROSOFT_TENANT=common`). Pick *single tenant* only if it's
   solely for your org — then set `MICROSOFT_TENANT` to your tenant ID.
4. **Redirect URI:** platform **Web**, value:
   `http://localhost:3000/auth/microsoft/callback`
5. Click **Register**.
6. Copy the **Application (client) ID** → this is `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID`.
7. Left menu → **Certificates & secrets** → **New client secret** → copy the
   secret **Value** (not the Secret ID) → this is `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET`.
   ⚠ The value is shown only once.
8. Left menu → **API permissions** → **Add a permission** → **Microsoft Graph**
   → **Delegated permissions** → add **`Calendars.Read`** and **`User.Read`**
   → **Add permissions**.

## 2. Register the Google Cloud app (Google Calendar)

1. Go to the **Google Cloud Console** → <https://console.cloud.google.com> →
   create or select a project.
2. **APIs & Services** → **Library** → search **"Google Calendar API"** →
   **Enable**.
3. **APIs & Services** → **OAuth consent screen**:
   - User type **External** → Create.
   - Fill app name + your email; **Save and continue**.
   - **Scopes:** add `.../auth/calendar` (needed for read + write access).
   - **Test users:** add your own Google address (required while the app is in
     "Testing" mode).
4. **APIs & Services** → **Credentials** → **Create credentials** →
   **OAuth client ID**:
   - **Application type:** Web application.
   - **Authorised redirect URIs:** add
     `http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback`
   - **Create**.
5. Copy the **Client ID** → `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and the
   **Client secret** → `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

## 3. Where to paste the credentials

Copy the example env file and edit it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in:

```ini
PORT=3000
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
SESSION_SECRET=<any long random string>

MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=...        # from Azure step 6
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=...    # from Azure step 7
MICROSOFT_TENANT=common        # or your tenant ID for org-only

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...           # from Google step 5
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...       # from Google step 5

# Optional — protect the app with a password when hosting on a server:
# AUTH_PASSWORD=your-secret-password

# Optional — let the widget cache events on disk for offline use (off by default):
# UNIFIED_CALENDAR_WIDGET_CACHE=1
```

> The code reads these in `src/config.js`. You never edit source for
> credentials — everything lives in `.env`.

## 4. Run it locally

```bash
npm install
npm start          # or: npm run dev   (auto-restart on file changes)
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. Click **Connect** next to Outlook and/or Google,
approve the consent screen, and your merged events appear.

---

### Notes & troubleshooting

- **`redirect_uri_mismatch`** → the URI in Azure/Google must *exactly* match
  `http://localhost:3000/auth/<provider>/callback` (scheme, port, path).
- **Google "access blocked / app not verified"** → add your account under
  *OAuth consent screen → Test users*.
- **Events disappear after ~1 hour** → access tokens expire; the app
  auto-refreshes using the refresh token. If a provider was connected before
  refresh tokens were granted, Disconnect and Connect again.
- **Only one calendar shows** → a per-provider error banner appears at the top
  describing which API failed and why; the other calendar still renders.
- **Changing `PORT`/`BASE_URL`?** Update the redirect URIs in Azure and Google
  to match, and update the `ExecStart` environment in `calendar.service`.
- **Hosting on a server?** Set `BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com` so OAuth
  callbacks and the `Secure` cookie flag work correctly. Add
  `AUTH_PASSWORD=...` to protect the app.
